    <p>The defining moment was when the velvet unicorn poster was replaced by the enormous poster of the boys. My dad came into my room later and asked &quot;are those boys or girls?&quot;</p>  <p>I knew they were the portal to everything I needed. I didn’t know who I was until I met them. I read everything about them I could, obsessed. My focus narrowed on the smartest, cleverest and prettiest one in the band. I hung on his every word in the teen mag interviews. I knew he liked prawns, strawberries, and Remy Martin. I would toast a drink to poster Nick with a crystal tumbler of Sunshine Punch Kool-Aid every night. I stayed up late and tape-recorded the audio from <i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</i> and listened to it on my Walkman, memorizing the timbre of his voice. I read Andy Warhol’s <i>From A to B and Back Again</i> because he did. Bought and wore the Yves St. Laurent lipstick he wore. Limited my clothing color palette to black, white, grey and red. Bought myself a leather tie. I wanted to inhabit him in every way.</p>  <p>Twenty-something years later, I had a creative crisis and asked myself the question, &quot;Why the fuck was I bothering?&quot; It struck me that it was all his fault. It also struck me that my queerness was also all his fault. My attraction was to those who existed in liminal gender spaces, the femme-est men and the butchest women. My interest in Duran Duran’s music had sharply dropped after 1987, but I decided to catch up after years of not paying attention. I spied on various fan communities to learn the latest gossip. I collaborated with drag kings, models, musicians and performance artists on a wide variety of projects. Some fans found my work and called me &quot;a crazy stalker.&quot;</p></div>

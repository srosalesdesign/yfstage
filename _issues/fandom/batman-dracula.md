    <div class="text-wrapper"><p>BATMAN DRACULA (2017) is a reenactment of Andy Warhol and Jack Smith’s unfinished collaborative film of the same title from 1964. Overlaying original footage (sourced from YouTube) with new footage shot in my garden, the dreamlike images become visuals for the soundtrack of Klaus Nomi’s live performance of Henry Purcell’s “Cold Song” from 1982 (also sourced from YouTube). In this new music video format, Smith’s cape (in my impersonation of Smith) has been decorated with the motifs of Steven Arnold’s iconic photographs. As a work of performance, Warhol, Smith, Nomi, Purcell, Arnold, and King Arthur become overlapping audio and visual references collapsing in time, space, and interweaving narrative within the site of my desire to locate lineage. In the spirit of Kembra Pfahler’s working methodology availabism, I use the materials that are available to me: things that are Google-able and downloadable. The resulting forced collaborations may be inspirational or irresponsible paradoxes of the impossible and possible. I can never ask these collaborators for permission so is it even collaboration? Is it fandom? What are the rules to fandom? Where does fan art fall on the spectrum between teenage fantasies and museum collections? </p>
    <p>Age, time, disease, distance, finances, governments, and ability are a few of many factors that can keep individuals from meeting. In CALLING ALL DIVAS, I investigate, converse, collaborate, and fantasize with persona, costume, text, movement and music to create chapters that focus specifically on queer inspiration. By imitating, honoring, listening, and conjuring people and characters, my body becomes a site of devastation and possibility. I momentarily experience something I can never fully realize or become something I can never fully be. This is actual and symbolic. The references are political figures: feminist, queer, HIV+, POC, movement leaders, revolutionaries, academics, and artists…the chapters continue to compound.</p>
    <p>Deviant in the face of product-oriented economic logics, this project does not intend to draw conclusions, state facts, or conclude any kinds of clear theses. It engages activities that probably seem pointless, wasteful, or unproductive to those stranded in heternormative temporalities. Rather, queers, women, people of color, frustrated heteros, and other marginalized people can find an invigorating essence to take beyond the dominant prescribed methods of identification and inheritance in the face of violence, oppression, erasure and loss.</p>

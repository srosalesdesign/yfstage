    <div class="text-wrapper"><p>Ana Mendieta was born in Havana, Cuba in 1948. In 1961, during the Cuban Revolution, she and her younger sister were separated from their family and sent to the United States via Operation Pedro Pan, through which over 14,000 Cuban children were similarly relocated. Initially arriving in Miami, the Mendieta sisters were eventually sent to Iowa, where they were met with abuse at the hands of their peers and the various adults they found themselves in the care of. Despite this, Mendieta and her sister remained in Iowa into their adulthoods and Mendieta eventually earned her BA, MA in painting, and MFA in Intermedia at the University of Iowa. It was during her time in the latter program that she began her Siluetas series (1973 – c.1980), the work for which she is best known. A few years after completing her studies in 1977, she moved to New York, where she met and began a romantic relationship with famed minimalist artist Carl Andre, who she would eventually marry.</p>

<p>On September 8, 1985, Ana Mendieta fell out of the 34th floor bedroom window of the apartment she shared with Andre, who was subsequently arrested and put on trial for her murder. He was found not guilty, though this could be the result of egregious errors made by the police in the first hours after Mendieta’s death—errors including immediately treating the suspicious death as a suicide, not photographing the body, and allowing both Andre and his lawyer to enter the apartment from which she fell while it was still under investigation as an active crime scene. He has since spoken of that night, but each account he gives is different from the last. Most recently, he said that she slipped while trying to close the window, finally acknowledging that she did indeed yell “No” right before falling, as he has always denied, most notably during his trial for Mendieta’s murder. In order to close the window, she would have had to climb a heater that was nearly her own size and stand atop it in order to reach the rectangular opening 34 stories above ground, all while being deathly afraid of heights.</p>

<p>While her work was made several decades ago, it is important that we refuse the sentiment that we have moved on from the issues they confront. We are continually faced with the murder of people of color at the hands of police; with ICE raiding homes, going into schools, or simply deporting those who are doing standard check-ins; with gender-based violence against womxn, particularly trans womxn; the list goes on. And the violence does not stop there. In addition to the daily shit we have to put up with, those othered by society are erased from history, from view through gentrifiaction, and thus have had to develop other methods of knowledge transfer&mdash;usually performative and/or oral. Our histories, much like Mendieta’s death, are shrouded in “maybes,” in gravitating towards what feels true and familiar rather than knowledge based on fact or evidence. It is precisely in this lack, in this consistent inability to prove certain truths when the definition of what counts as evidence is an extension of the same system that oppresses you, that Mendieta’s work and the story of her death feels so familiar, that Andre feels&mdash;but will never definitively be&mdash;guilty.</p>

<p>For the past four years, I have been developing a body of work based on reconstructing and re-performing segments of the life and work of Ana Mendieta. Mendieta once stated that the
repetition found in her work was an “obsessive act of reasserting [her] ties with the earth,” and the repetition of her work and story in my own is my obsessive act of reasserting my ties to her. These attempted reassertions, however, always fail; she never quite finds home, I never quite find her. They insist on and produce constant, repetitive movement met with constant, repetitive failure. My work does not attempt to resolve or prove anything. They are reconstructions of sorts, providing specific practices or information, but moving towards emotional truths, ones just as factual and theoretically sound as those recorded and archived while resisting inclusion in that system. In 1980, Ana Mendieta curated Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States at New York’s A.I.R. Gallery. The catalogue’s introduction describes the show as pointing “not necessarily to the injustice or incapacity of a society that has not been willing to include us, but more towards a personal will to continue being ‘other.’” It is within this “personal will to continue being ‘other’” that I have always been attracted to in her work and try to continue in my own.</p>

<p>Rather than define performance re-enactments as separate from the original acts they attempt to recreate, performance studies scholar Rebecca Schneider states that they are “in fact the ongoing event itself, negotiated through sometimes radically shifting affiliation with the past as the present.” I try to keep Mendieta’s work alive while also examining the ways in which she used her practice as an embodied survival tactic for someone who felt she had no home, whose narrative was constantly being erased, questioned, or fetishized by those around her.</p>

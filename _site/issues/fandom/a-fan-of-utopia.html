    <div class="text-wrapper">
    <p>I am a fan of Utopia. I am especially a fan of those who’ve offered a recipe for Utopia. The concepts that ground the philosophy and theory present/ed in my film, The Ladies Almanack, (2017) propose tools for building the future as we want it.</p>
    <p>We the living are extensions of the past. Therefore to know who we are we must “always look back.”</p>
    <p>The film looks back to a cadre of artists and writers based in Paris circa 1926-8. Based on a groundbreaking novel by Djuna Barnes, the story focuses on the friends and lovers of the cultural powerhouse, Natalie Clifford Barney.</p>
    <p><i>In The Ladies Almanack</i> the voice of the narrator which is not one states by way of introduction:</p>
    <div class="inset">
    <p>Monique Wittig: Our story is not comprehensive nor symbolic, but small and hard and real for some. Perhaps for many. Because a lesbian is a real thing, insistent if unpopular. A perspective, specific and narrow. How to speak with a collective, but non-generalized voice?</p>
<p>Hélène Cixous: How to live crying out with frightened joy over the pitfall of words? Fortunately, when someone says woman we still don’t know what that means. Even if we know what we want to mean.</p>
<p>Luce Irigiray: Who we address, a very special audience, as Barnes herself will come to say, that selective sisterhood is perhaps less necessary to know: for they will know themselves.</p>
</div>

<h1>Footnotes here???</h1>

<p>To speak of a “we” is always risky. But Utopia demands on a community, a “selective sisterhood” that is specific and complex. The first step is defining that community. In The Ladies Almanack and elsewhere I use the term Lesbian. Another term I find useful in narrowing the “we” is Radical.  Radicals can be defined as individuals aching to be free, who know their liberation is bound up in the liberations of all, and who actively build toward a future that is not like this now. A radical would find truth in Wittig's, “all action is overthrow.”  A radical makes Utopia, while others wait.</p>

<p>The film is not easy to consume.  Partially this is intended to do the original cryptic Barnes novel justice, but it is also intended to demand a level of literacy from my audiences. From the project’s inception we (myself and producer Stephanie Acosta) determined that our aims in making this work were both educational and utopic. “If this film does not spike the sales of these posthumous authors, maybe even necessitate a reprinting, than we will have failed.” I proclaimed to her somewhere in 2014. While we have yet to see if our cinematic fan-zine will impact the literary market, (the film only just premiered in July, 2017) we can re-introduce these writers as a call to radicalize literary education.</p>

<p>Educators of any stripe: you must stop teaching the canon. When Uncle Tom’s Cabin remains on syllabi but Sojourner Truth’s speeches are not taught, teachers are being lazy and our culture and lives suffer. She who teaches James Joyce and not Djuna Barnes should ask herself if she should be teaching at all. Barnes, Joyce and Truth use language toward freedom. But where Barnes and Truth propose utopias, Joyce’s proposed world is the one we live in today. Dominant culture has been formed by books they told us to read over others. What makes a work of literature “important?” Catcher in the Rye is a pseudo-radical book whose popularity has helped to create the world we live in. But it does not offer tools for a way out.</p>

<p>It is not only teachers who are responsible for what we read. When I name literacy as one of the main aims of my work, I mean that if you can read, you are responsible to society to read. And you are responsible for what you read. If we are not collecting tools to break down this system then we are actively building it up.</p>

<p>My art ( and my life) could be seen as a huge fan-zine to inspirational women of the past and present. Even as I write this I take breaks to create fan videos of LeCiel (my partner in culture) singing. An act that occurs as regularly as breathing between us and with as little fanfare. (no pun intended.) Does this mean  I, as a “fan” live for others? Even those who are dead, who may never know me? If we are to make utopia again, absolutely. We must sing each other’s praises because it is that song that becomes history.</p>

<h1 style="font-style: italic;">You for whom I wrote, O beautiful young women!
You alone whom I loved, will you reread my verse…? <br />-From the tomb of Renée Vivien, poet.
</h1>


<p>Vivien was a lover of Natalie Clifford Barney and neighbors with Colette for a period of time. Long dead already by 1926, the character enters the film as a story told, a memory kept. “Would it not be the height of Cowardice to allow our dead to die?” Barney wrote, a quote that floats into the film as one of the inter-titles set between scenes.</p>

<p>One of Barney’s most radical contributions was the example of her love life. The entanglements between the women of Barney’s web were not always harmonious, in fact tensions and jealousy outline the perimeters of each character, shading and polishing an emotional bas-relief each woman forms with one another in the film. Non-monogamy (as opposed to polyamory) seems to be unafraid of these inevitable pricks and cuts. Barney and her friends get hurt but remain sexually free.  In response to Mimi Franchetti’s comment on Barney’s salon: “I can’t help but wonder what such a mixed crowd could possibly have in common.” Barney replies “My friends, they all like when it rains.” Does Barney intend sexual innuendo or does she imply a depression-welcoming self-loving courage-despite-pain attitude among her circle? Probably both.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">The women say that they perceive their bodies in their entirety…</p>

<p> In contrast to popular notions of “open relationships” and polyamory,  Barney’s relationships have no scheduled “nights off” or rules governing what one lover can do with another. Instead, they abide only by one radical notion: nobody owns anybody.</p>

<p>In summation, a recipe for Utopia: <br />A self-selecting, specifically defined, intergenerational community that honors complexity, self-love, and depth. 
</p>
<p>A culture that looks forward and back, aligned with a sense of heritage without nostalgia yet alert to the uniqueness of the present, and armed with the courage required to build something new.</p> 

<p>Deep professional and emotional commitments to each other that rely on the basic rule that nobody owns anybody.</p>
